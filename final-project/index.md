The VR field and community has always been driven by rapid, project-based development. We wanted to reflect this in the course by giving you the opportunity to work on your own VR application. For your final project, you'll be working on all aspects of developing a VR application, starting from forming teams and project ideas and culminating in showcasing it to others.

# Quick Logistics

- All deliverables for this project are due at the end of semester showcase.
- The Preliminary Project Proposal is the first step of the process.
- Groups and initial ideas are set during the in-class Mixer.
- Final Project Proposals are assigned during the Mixer.
- Groups must consist of 3-4 people from the class.
- Projects must be applications built in Unity for the Oculus platform.
- There will be an expo event at the end of the semester where you'll be able to show off your work to each other, the XR@B club, and the general public!

# Project Overview

Your project will be a Unity application built on the Oculus platform. We put emphasis on the word "application" - it must be something that someone else could find value in using. While the contents of your project are entirely up to you, we ask that you strive to meet the following design goals:

1. **You must be able to demo it**. This means that you can put someone new to VR into your application and, with some external guidance by the one running the demo, have them experience/understand the gist of your project within 3 to 5 minutes. That isn't to say that your entire content must be shown within that time frame, just that you should be able to get the selling points across.
2. **It should bring something new to the table**. There are many companies and studios out there able to spend millions of dollars refining the perfect survival wave shooter game. Come up with something that hasn't been seen yet or adequately explored. It could be a new game mechanic, a untapped use case, or a novel way of storytelling. On the flip side, however, don't worry if the cool thing you've come up with is already being done in some hackathon or startup somewhere - there are always multiple facets to the same idea.
3. **It should benefit from being in VR**. This class is all about tapping into VR's potential, and that can't be properly shown if what you build could have been done just as well as a web page or mobile app. Take advantage of this new medium! Always ask yourself the question, "Why VR?"
   
These are difficult requirements to hit. You should be able to justify how you met each goal to us, but they also will not decide your grade alone.

# Group and Idea Formation

The final project starts with the Preliminary Project Proposal. Individually fill out this form with an idea that you'd like to work on. **This is due the day before the in-class Mixer**.

In class, we will be hold an "idea mixer" after lecture. Styled after similar events at hackathons, this time is to give you a chance to discuss project ideas with other students and form teams around promising ideas. We'll start by giving everyone a minute to pitch their project proposal to the class, then give you time to talk and discuss with others. We will provide information from everyone's submitted ideas so you can easily find people with similar interests.

Groups should include 3-4 people from the class. By the end of class that day, we expect you to *inform us of your team members and project idea*. If there's time remaining, facilitators will work with your team in refining the idea into something in scope for the class, as well as give you advice on how you might start implementing it.

After your group has been formed, your team should fill out the Final Project Proposal form. This will go into more detail about your project idea and how you intend to implement it / distribute the workload. This form is due a week after the mixer.

*Important: If you are unable to attend class that day, we recommend you start early on finding a group, either in-class or on Ed. Otherwise, please let the facilitator team know and we'll match you to a group.*

# Grading

From the syllabus, the final project is worth 30% of your total grade. This can be broken up into facilitator grades (20%), peer evaluations (5%), and the two proposal forms (2.5% each). This will be our rubric for judging projects:

| CRITERIA | DESCRIPTION | WEIGHT |
| Technical | - Consistent visuals (no missing textures, broken models, etc.) <br> - Smooth performance (90 fps) <br> - Bug free | 33.3% |
| User Experience | - Intuitive controls and interactions <br> - No motion sickness <br> - Immersion | 33.3% |
| Value | - Clear vision <br> - Benefits from being in VR <br> - Explores something new | 33.3% |
