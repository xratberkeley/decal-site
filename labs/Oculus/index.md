# Meta Quest

These labs use Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit (XRI) and a Meta Quest headset. These labs are supposed to be done in small groups, and be started and finished in class. If you are not able to finish - as long as you have showed effort that you tried to finish the lab, you will get checked off.

# Prerequisites
This lab is designed for use with Unity 2022 LTS (2022.3.7f1). We will be building to Android, so when installing the editor, be sure to select the Android Module. You can do this after installation too.
